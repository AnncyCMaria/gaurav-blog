                        During my internship at CAT I learned about SalesForce and developed an SalesForce1 App. Doing it was very much fun and exciting because it was a ‘live’ project. however I had faced lot of challenges while working on SalesForce, understanding Bootstrap and using jQuery library more efficiently because it was something which I had never done before. I loved working on this project and putting my classroom knowledge into actual working models, and I love my college for giving me such opportunities. I used and enhanced my skills of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery library, Bootstrap and basic SalesForce development during my tenure.

                        After Joining Caterpillar, till today I have worked on two Major projects for Caterpillar’s client as a Full Stack Developer and few internal projects which were more of continuous improvements.
